synchronize(): I detected 332 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1357

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 227 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1358

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 227 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1128

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 295 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1255

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 274 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1233

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 227 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1358

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.

For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.

synchronize(): I detected 295 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1255

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 235 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1180

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.

[Warning: findmatchingevents(): For event type "1", multiple (2) ET events were found within the searchRadius of 4 samples around
the EEG event! We will take the closest ET event. However, this can cause trouble for synchronization. If you have send many
events of the same type in close temporal succession during your experiment, then consider decreasing the "searchRadius" in

-- 561119 EEG samples in synchronization range
-- 684699 ET samples in synchronization range
-- 500.00 Hz EEG sampling rate
-- 610.12 Hz estimated ET sampling rate [*]
   ([*] taking EEG as master clock & assuming the ET recording was never paused)
-- Eye track will be downsampled to match the EEG sampling rate

-- Note: the toolbox does not yet implement a low-pass filter to prevent aliasing.


synchronize(): I detected 235 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1154

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:
